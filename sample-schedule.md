# Sample Timeline (Tim)

* 9AM: get on train, address emails and other low-energy tasks
* 10AM:
    * Get to office
    * Check Gerrit for Europe reviews
    * Read git log to see changes I missed; ping people about anything suspicious
    * Any scheduled meetings (mostly with Europe & NYC)
    * Check JIRA to see what my day looks like; start work on tickets
* 12PM: Lunch
* 1:30PM: Standup
* 2PM:
    * Any scheduled meetings (mostly with west coast)
    * More work
* 5PM: train home, low-energy tasks like emails
* 6PM: home, depending on mood either work more or not

Note on work-life balance: don't feel pressured to take work home, and if you do, feel free to leave early and not work any more to "make up" for your time. Also don't feel peer pressured to work at an unsustainable level.

If you have a doctor's appointment, etc., just give notice in the team Slack channel and ping me as well and you're good to go.
